# donjon-to-ssv-meterial
This is a standalone php application that you can put anywhere to convert the Donjon generated dungeons for an optimized viewing experience on a website with MaterializeCSS implemented (as the ssv-material theme for wordpress).

Go to http://donjon.bin.sh/5e/dungeon/ to generate your own dungeon, download the HTML file and load that into the converter.
